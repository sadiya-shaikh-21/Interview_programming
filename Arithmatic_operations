/*
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, A and B. Add code to print seven lines where:

First line shows the sum of two integers A and B.
Second line shows the difference between two numbers(A-B).
Third line shows the product of the two integers A and B.
Fourth line shows the Integer Division where A is the numerator and B is the denominator.
Fifth line shows the Float Division where A is the numerator and B is the denominator.
Sixth line shows the Remainder when A is divided by B.
Seventh line shows the Power i.e AB
