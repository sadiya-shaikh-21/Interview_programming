Problem Description

Given a sorted array A containing N integers both positive and negative.

You need to create another array containing the squares of all the elements in A and return it in non-decreasing order.

Try to this in O(N) time.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105.

-103 <= A[i] <= 103



Input Format
First and only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format
Return a integer array as described in the problem above.

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def solve(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        for i in range(n):
            A[i] = A[i] * A[i]
        A.sort()
        return A
